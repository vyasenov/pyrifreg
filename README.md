# pyrifreg [coming soon]

A Python package for Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regression analysis. Provides tools for analyzing distributional effects in econometrics and data science applications.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install pyrifreg
```

## Features

- Implementation of Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regression
- Support for various distributional statistics (mean, quantiles, variance, gini, etc.)
- Easy-to-use API for regression analysis
- Integration with pandas and scikit-learn

## Background

#### Motivation: From Conditional to Unconditional Effects

Most of you are familiar with conditional moments—e.g.

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y \mid X = x]
$$

or conditional quantiles

$$
Q_\tau(Y \mid X = x).
$$

But policy questions often concern how a change in some covariate $X$ shifts the *entire* (marginal or unconditional) distribution of an outcome $Y$.  For instance:

* **Inequality analysis:**  How would increasing education change the 90th vs.\ 10th percentile of the wage distribution?
* **Welfare evaluation:**  What is the impact of a cash transfer on the variance or Gini of consumption?

Formally, let $F_Y$ be the baseline distribution of $Y$, and imagine a small intervention on $X$ that perturbs $F_Y$ to $G_Y$.  For a scalar functional $\nu(\cdot)$ (e.g.\ mean, variance, quantile), define the *unconditional policy effect*:

$$
\Delta\nu \;=\;\nu(G_Y)\;-\;\nu(F_Y).
$$

Our goal is to estimate how “marginal shifts” in $X$ translate into $\Delta\nu$.

#### Influence Functions (IF)

An **influence function** captures the *first‐order* sensitivity of a distributional functional $T(F)$ to an infinitesimal contamination at the point $y$.  Concretely, define

$$
F_\varepsilon = (1-\varepsilon)F + \varepsilon\,\delta_y,
$$

where $\delta_y$ is a point‐mass at $y$.  Then

$$
\mathrm{IF}(y;\,T, F)
\;=\;
\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}
\frac{T(F_\varepsilon) - T(F)}{\varepsilon}.
$$

IFs tell us "how much does a single observation at $y$ “pull” the estimator of $T$ away from its nominal value".

#### Recentered Influence Functions (RIF)

Since $\mathbb{E}_F[\mathrm{IF}(Y;T,F)] = 0$, we cannot regress $\mathrm{IF}(Y)$ directly to target $T(F)$.  The **recentered influence function** adds back the functional:

$$
\mathrm{RIF}(y;\,T, F)
\;=\;
T(F)\;+\;\mathrm{IF}(y;\,T, F).
$$

Key property:

$$
\mathbb{E}_F[\mathrm{RIF}(Y)] \;=\; T(F).
$$

Thus $\mathrm{RIF}(Y)$ is an *unbiased* “pseudo‐outcome” for $T(F)$, which we can now relate to covariates.

#### RIF Regression

A **RIF regression** proceeds in two steps:

1. **Compute**  the plug‐in estimate $T(\widehat F)$ and the influence function $\mathrm{IF}(y_i;T,\widehat F)$ for each $i$.
2. **Form** the RIF outcome $r_i = T(\widehat F) + \mathrm{IF}(y_i;\,T,\widehat F),$ and **estimate** the linear model

   $$
     r_i \;=\; x_i^\top\beta \;+\;\varepsilon_i.
   $$

Under regularity conditions (smoothness of $T$, overlap in $X$, etc.), each component $\beta_j$ approximates the *marginal effect* of $X_j$ on the unconditional functional $T(F_Y)$.

#### Unconditional Quantile Regression (UQR)

Unconditional quantile regression is simply RIF regression with $T(F)=Q_\tau(Y)$.  Then:

$$
r_i = Q_\tau(Y) \;+\;\frac{\tau - \mathbf{1}\{y_i \le Q_\tau\}}{f_Y(Q_\tau)},
$$

and regressing $r_i$ on $X$ yields estimates of how a marginal change in each $X_j$ shifts the $\tau$-th **marginal** quantile of $Y$. In contrast. conditional QR gives you how $X$ shifts the *conditional* quantile $Q_\tau(Y\mid X)$; UQR gives *population‐level* shifts. Personally, I find the former quantity this much less interpretable or meaningful.

---

#### Inference

Inference in RIF regression proceeds via a two‐stage procedure—first estimating the target functional $T(\widehat F)$, any necessary density (e.g.\ $f_Y(Q_\tau)$), and the influence values $\mathrm{IF}(y_i)$, then regressing the recentered outcomes on covariates; because the RIFs are themselves estimated, naïve OLS standard errors are inconsistent and must be adjusted. The package supports bootstrap estimation of standard errors.

## Quick Start

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pyrifreg import RIFRegression

# Create sample data
X = np.random.randn(1000, 2)
y = np.random.randn(1000)

# Initialize and fit RIF regression
median_rif = RIFRegression(statistic='quantile', q=0.5)
median_rif.fit(X, y)

# Get regression results
results = median_rif.summary()
print(results)
```
